I went to wednesday night TA hours. Logan Hankla and I talked about the assignment together. I've worked with Java before, but not for awhile. I really like Java, I feel like it's good at what it's meant to do. Programming languages in general parse down commands to the most simple string of words that still has meaning and then assigns that command one specific meaning. They are all a collection of simple phrases that you can link together and nest within one anotehr to perform complex tasks. My program works with some very specific exceptions, because I used uncommon strings of letters and numbers as placeholders. Otherwise, when I went through the string replacing I with you, and then went through again replacing you with I, I would end up with all I's. My advice is to sometimes accept that your code is good enough â€“ that you've learned what you were meant to learn from the assignment and it's time to move on!
